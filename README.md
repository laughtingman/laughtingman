## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton. I'm a full-stack developer in a well-known in certain circles financial company, engaged in BPM, CRM and EDI systems.

Besides the main direction I write web applications, personal offices and sites of different complexity, and in my free time I write a lot of useful and not so useful software for myself and for my soul.

I like music, movies, books, TV series, anime, board games, traveling, cooking and eating.
